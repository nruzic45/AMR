A repository containing basic algorithms used in mobile robotics that contains:
* A basic data processing package developed in ROS.
* ROS odometry based controller for the turtlebot robot.
* Recursive and Iterative Split&Merge algorithm implementation based on LIDAR data.
* Kalman filter based localization module. Uses extracted features from the Split&Merge algorithm and deploys a Kalman filter that corrects the features obtainted from the Odometry model.
